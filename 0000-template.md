# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The Rust Platform is the next generation of the product released by
The Rust Project, batteries included. It consistents of the greatest
Rust libraries, and the greatest Rust tools. And it all runs on every
platform, and integrates with every software stack.

(TODO this sucks) This RFC describes the components of the product, including libraries
and tools, technical details of how it will be constructed and
delivered. It further describes the processes necessary to ensure a
reliable product and vibrant development community.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

In 2016 Rust is a great success. We've created the core af the most
powerful and versatile software platform in the world. The product the
Rust Project delivers today is great: high quality, consistently
delivered. But it is still just the core of the greater
product we're all working toward.

The development leading to 1.0 was the most active time in the
projects history. Having a well defined goal, and a timeline toward it
was a great unifying and motivating factor for the project, and we
achieved great things.  Since 1.0 our goals have been more diffuse
... etc.


Need lots more here.


(bleh) Upon completion of the work described here Rust users will have access
to a single product that provides seamless convenient access to
diverse high quality libraries designed to interoperate, and the tools
they need to be an effective Rust developer. They can expect their
software to work consistently on an exceptionally diverse set of
platforms, and integrate with most existing software stacks.

This is all bs.

While this RFC considers IDEs to be in scope for the the Rust Platform,
there are too many unknowns to place it into the context of the overall
product roadmap. IDEs are discussed in [an appendix](#appendix-ides).

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Notes

We should make an effort to convert all rust crates to the platform metapackage.
Need to test all rustc/cargo revisions against all metapackages.
